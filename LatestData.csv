I like how Dr Hanifah and the other doctors listen and try to understand what I am going through. Thank you Doc.
It is also close to Setapak Sentral incase you need to buy something after check up and Columbia Hospital incase you need a hospital referral. A lot of food options around it as well.",,,1Positive#Staff
2,"Been there recently. Long queue as the clinic provides vaccine injection and only one doctor serves the patients. They should prioritize patient who comes for medical check up or make two doctors available at the clinics. One hour waiting for my med check up.
Nurses ok. The doctor was a bit fierce. I talked nicely but the doctor seemed angry.. Maybe she just stressed of the overwhelming number of patients.

First of all, the reception was very unfriendly, they  been laughed at me when they ask for my IC and I gave them my IC number instead. I felt uncomfortable with the attitude, and you should just ask again instead of laughing at your patient.
Secondly , the doctor I visit named DR.MALCOM , I repeat DR.MALCOM, I repeat again DR.MALCOM. I was having period pain at the point I had fainted during work, my supervisor suggested me to take MC after few hours of work, but at the session, the time I had told him that I had a menstrual pain he straight brushed of my words and didn’t believe me like I was faking MC or something. He even said something like “You should asked your supervisor to give you a letter of consent / approval before you come and visit me.” Hello ??? Does it changes anything if I have that letter to show you ? You can’t wake a person who are fake sleeping so do you DON’T WANT TO believe your patient’s words. However he did done some body checking for me but it was take NO MORE THAN 5 minutes and said that I was fine / can’t find anything wrong with you.
Zero Empathy, Rude Attitude, Job Avoidance. I wonder how much money you’ve paid for the college / universities to fake a Doctor Certificate.
While I was trying to “fight back” which is trying to explain that I was sick, he put a full stop on that session by telling me “It’s ok miss, if you’re not satisfied with my services, you are glad to complain me from the ministry.
Last but not least, after all the accusations , judgmental and unreasonable hassle for the good old DR.MALCOM, without any advice and positive feedback, I was charged RM15 from my AIA member, and I was asked to give a RM5 consultation fees. I admit that this was my mistake that I should’ve leave earlier before they called my name and ask for the consultation fees, and should have cancel the appointment from my AIA app before they’ve got the chance to charge from my end.

he brushed off all my comments and finished up the session real quick. 15 years of experience and a Doctor in front of his name but none of the qualities, intellect or empathy that comes hand in hand with being a doctor.

My child was the patient and unfortunately does not speak the local language, but everyone from counter staff to doctor were professional and friendly. The doctor's caring bedside manner and attempts to converse ensured that my child was not anxious at all.

133,"Went to this Clinic today as i'm having a sore throat, to the extend that i'm no longer able to swallow nor drink anymore. And it is painful and only to one side of my throat and it hurts my jaw. However, the doctor here, she refused to meet me in her consultation room and choose to stand far apart from me in the registration room between the glass door. Asking me question on my medical conditions - where is the doctor-patient confidentiality here?
She told me, sore throat is a symptom to Covid-19 and she unable to allow me in- I understood that here too.
I told the doctor, I don't have any other symptom just the sore throat, and when i was about to say that i took RTK this morning, she straight away said that RTK is not accurate to detach the virus, i told her that im schedule to take PCR test tomorrow wednesday from my company my company provide onsite PCR test to all staff every Wednesday since Sept last year and i do it ever Wednesday.
She said to me that, yesterday a patient who is positive walked in with only a headache and still positive, even no symptom you can still be positive.
Honestly, i've lost words here, i just needed treatment, i just asked the doctor that if she can just give me some antibiotic or something cause i really unable to talk or even swallow my own saliva anymore then she said sure but u cant walk around, go home straight i told her that she need to gave me MC for that then, she said ok...
I turned  around and there are 2 other patient there, and they heard all the conversation and how it was done, i felt so humiliated.
I went there at 1PM during my lunch time, my office is just around the corner and i wasnt there for just an MC.
No examination was done, she didn't bother to take my temperature, blood pressure or to even look at my throat. And to my suprised the doctor wasn't even in her PPE.
I was having a bad fever last month, but a doctor in the other clinic treated me so well, even told me that ""you are really sick and you troat looks bad, pls go home and take a good rest"".She just asked me to do RTK every 4days.
Why i wrote this long, is because i am the disgruntled few that willing to share this experience to others and also to this Clinic for them to improve and do something about it.Even if you have to pay rental 4-5times more than other clinics do is not something that patient will remember you by. If you give best services with empathy and care, people will keep on coming and you don't have to worry about your rent.
Anyway, wish you all the best and for sure i wont go there anymore, will visit my doctor tonight again. Thank you.Have a great day ahead.",,,1Negative#Staff#Treatment
134,"Went for pre-emp check up. It was around 11am and there was a line of foreigners waiting for check up too for their work permit renewal. I walked in to the register area and the staff was looking stress and said to come back again around 11.30 with a little i-am-busy-now-dont-bother-me kinda look. Well i went out and came back in again at 11.30 and luckily this time i got registered and were asked for some urine sample and so they directed me to their own washroom which is located in the clinic at the back. Fast forward to my blood test. Worst experience ever. I mean I have done blood test that requires 4 vial of my blood and yet i felt nothing and it was done in less than 2mins but this... this was bad. The nurse, i assumed, attempted to draw my blood first but failed. She asked me a few times if i have ever done blood test but i should have asked her instead if she has ever drawn blood before. So in the end she failed and requested the doctor on duty to do it instead. Well all i can say is that the doctor was no better. So blood was taken and now a new nightmare appear. The nurse told me that i was positive for opiates! This must be a joke. I told the nurse and the doctor that i do not take drugs. The doctor deduced that i do and that i was hiding and suggested if it is for recreational purpose and that he can help if yes. Why do i need your help cause i know i did not take any drugs. So we end up having me paying rm50 for a thorough lab test to be done by different party. So i had a feeling that this was all just a farce as this does not make any sense to me at all and fyi, it came back negative. I just take it as the ""doctor's fee"" for drawing my blood. While i was waiting for my receipt, i overheard the conversation from a staff telling one of the foreigner that they need urine sample and to use the mall washroom. It struck me right there and then that they are treating people differently. I thought i heard wrongly but thank god there was a local Malay lady who was also there for checkup and requires to provide urine sample but was asked to use the clinic own washroom instead. This was just right after the staff told the foreigner to use the mall washroom so the clinic washroom was empty. This is not right. shouldnt everyone be treated equally? Why the double standard? All in all, i can only say that this clinic is bad and has got to improve immediately. Mix reviews tell you 1 thing; that there is no standard at all in this clinic. Go at your own risk. If you are lucky, your visit might just be like one of those good reviews.",,,1Negative#Appointments#Staff#Treatment

I would appreciate it if you can explain it in a patient and nice way and not in a way that you would make your patient feel stupid just because they told you they have a migraine.

I understand your being suspicious of our reasons when we are asking for MC but please understand that it is our privilege to go on MC if we are not feeling well. Our  companies wouldn't mind if we die of working so hard that's why we deserve to rest if we are not feeling well. Even if it's just an acute migraine or whatsoever it's our right to go on MC and rest. She even ask my supervisors name and she told me she will speak to my supervisor. I don't know if she's trying to scare me or what but I feel that it's crazy.

Unethical and unprofessional
ENT specialist Clinic at Jalan Pudu
29/9/2017 around 3pm
Brought my grandad to see him..
My grandad had hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness, and hearing voices for about two years.. He has been seen by a GP who found that one of his ear drum was perforated.. Thus, we thought of bringing him to see a specialist for confirmation as well as further management..
After hearing my grandad’s symptoms, he didn’t bother to ask further in history taking, and straight away gave us a conclusion that my grandad’s problem was because of inflammation inside his nose..
This doctor did an endoscopy if his nose, and said that there was blockage of his nose by mucus and his nasal mucosa was inflamed.. To be honest, it looked normal to me (I had medical degree background)..
Fine.. what he did next what totally shocking.. He asked if my grandad is taking any blood thinning medications(was being asked twice, 1st time by his nurse during registration, and then by him during consultation)..
We told him “no”. He said “good”, then he used a forceps to scrape the normal looking nasal mucosa TWICE, until the bony part was seen, without telling us what was his reason of doing that.. (At that time, I just feel slightly weird as it is not a usual practice, but when I think back now, I think he was inducing the inflammation of nasal mucosa by injuring it!!!!, so that there will be nose inflammation!)
After that, he did a scope on his ears.. He showed us the normal side, nothing wrong.. eardrum is not perforated.. While showing another side, when there is a perforation clearly seen, he quickly remove the scope without showing us clearly (afraid of we might see the perforation?)
And he said “both ears are normal!! No perforation..”
???? Even a GP and a fresh medical graduate saw the perforation, how can a specialist miss that?
Followed by giving some common advices as what mentioned by other people here like “open all windows, don’t sleep on the floor 
The whole consultation lasted for less than 10 mins.. When I enquire the eardrum perforation, he said, “Didn’t you see I did the scope just now? No perforation right? ”
After that he became impatient and wanted to end the consultation quickly..
While going out of the consultation room, his nurse whispered to me that, “this doctor gave the same advices to all the patients”, I guess she was actually implying something to me..
At the end, we were charged RM428 for that.. RM 150 consultation fee, RM180 endoscopy, RM98 medications (antibiotics, anti inflammatory, nose drop, steroid cream)
When I think back now, this doctor just care about money instead of having the heart to treat patient.. Was actually keeping in mind that private clinic will have high charges but as long as the treatment is effective, we don’t mind paying that amount.. but not in this case..
Feel like cheated and disappointed with this kind of doctor who is totally a bad example that ruin this noble profession..
**Some people might ask why didn’t I ask the doctor on the spot.. To be honest, at that moment, I still lay my trust on him because of his specialist title and I’m just a fresh medical graduate..",,,1Negative#Staff#Treatment

219,"The charges are expensive. If you can go to other places to see, the doctor will say to do surgery to earn your insurance money, obviously it is not very serious. The nurse is more like a doctor, for example, how to spray medicine and cannot eat anything, the doctor will not say anything. He just watched! It’s just a patient. If you don’t ask the patient, you can only ask the nurse.
Several nurses said differently~ For example, medication, what can’t be eaten, I really don’t know who to listen to~
I don’t recommend anyone to come to see if someone is serious. I found that every patient who came to the doctor said that your nose is crooked and you need to have an operation.

Paying for hard work is the most appropriate description.
Upon entering the clinic, the nurse directly asked if he had come and explained the price list, and then stated that even if he did not get medicine, the medical fee would be RM350.
DR KHOR was casual when he diagnosed.
Poor attitude, very bad, impolite, impatient and rude during inspections.
When he said he wanted to suck my nose, just press me !!
It doesn't matter if I'm in pain or not, just insert the whole tube into my nose!
At least you give me a heart ready to take it slowly !!
Asked why it may cause ear obstruction and nose pus, DR KHOR has always said that you can’t sleep on an ordinary bed, but only on a wooden bed. You can’t have all the dolls.
Then let me go out and wait for medicine
Gave a lot of medicine, antibiotics gave two and other medicines

The  caring power of touch from an impeccable health care provider shows without words the gentle nature of how much they want to attend to your needs. The nursing staff have been here since decades I would love to name them all but that would mean naming everyone. Even the confinement food is  delicious  It may be old fashioned but the services fall nothing short of amazing.
If you are  expecting a 5 star Hotel  with concierge services take a baby moon holiday before you look for a Medical provider. Come for the Doctors ie. Dato Dr Roopi and Dr Aruna. Our visits through maternity were busy but both the Dr's are assuring and supportive. Its one of the only medical providers that promote natural birth delivery,  provided you are able to. Also their postpartum care is  superb
Keep a positive and open mind set and they will exceed  all your expectations. Trust me you will hope ROOPI Medical Center is around for all the children you may have in the future.

308,"After reading the bad reviews here, I felt worried and uneasy coming here but I don't agree with everything they wrote. The nurses are very caring and friendly, 1 or 2 rude staff cannot represent everyone, every hospital or company will have 1 or 2 bad eggs. Doctors and nurses were very professional and gentle and they explain everything properly. The wards and toilets are clean and they have all the medical equipments. It is just slightly pricey as the nurses are experienced maybe it's not cheap to run a medical centre. The nurses don't gossip about patients and they are very well mannered too.",,,1Positive#Facilities#Treatment

313,"I’ve gone to this hospital for my irregular period and hormonal imbalance issue on 17/7/2020. I was referred to Dr Roopi which is the same doctor who attended to my mum’s delivery 34 years ago (Yes, I was born at this hospital). Upon reaching the hospital, the nurse took down my details and reason for my visit that day and advised to drink lots of water to make my bladder full for scanning purposes. I was there at around 9.30 am and had to wait until 11 something, then I was called to see Dr Roopi in her room. With high hopes and assumption that I’m going to get a good solution to my sickness, I’ve entered her room and sat right in front of her. She just looked at me at one glance and ask what is the issue with myself. The moment I told her that I was not getting my period for the last 5 months, which is the first sentence I started it off, she stopped me right there and started to body-shame me with words like too fat, too big, horrible sight and so on in front of her nurse in the room. She immediately told me that I should not waste my money and time by doing scanning and also consulting another gynaecologist which is not going to work until I lose my weight. She even asked me to consult a psychiatrist, and I was speechless that how can a psychiatrist cure my hormonal and bodyweight issues when a Gynae herself can’t help? She didn’t even touch me to check anything and asked me to proceed with some psychological advise and get cosmetic surgery done to lose my weight. I immediately left the room with heartaches and ended up paying RM108 for nothing but just so much of hatred and body shaming. I’ve never come across such a medical expert with nonsense behaviour. I will never ever recommend this Doctor to anyone with the women’s issue as she is not the medical expert that you are looking for. I will definitely highlight this matter to the Medical Council of Malaysia and seek for lawyer’s attention. Dr Roopi does not deserve to be called a Doctor as she is the most heartless person and a disgrace to the doctor’s community!!!!!",,,1Negative#Staff#Treatment

The labour room was really unclean and looks very old. All the toilets in the building smells so bad. No waiting room for guest and they also treat guess very rudely. No visitors are allowed to carry the baby even the grandparents. Most of the equipments and beddings are really old. Even in government hospitals they are using electronic beds nowadays but Roopi using manual beds which is very painful for mother who just gave birth to adjust it. The wad is so small and no room for the patient to move. I will not recommend it to anyone.,,,1Negative#Facilities#Staff

331,"I delivered at Roopi medical centre recently. Have been going for prenatal check up over there as well. I’m glad I did a dual care in government clinic and in my mid pregnancy gov clinic was the one who detected I had polyhydroamionis.
Dr A at Roopi only acknowledged when I told her. Then I was asked to deliver via induction at week 40. It failed and had to undergo caesarean. Poor little bBy was placed away from mom. Yes and for your information they will only do jaundice test once after delivery. They don’t check on daily basis. Horrible.
Then, they serve you porridge with insects and when you complain, they say sorry and later serve you bread. Don’t they know mom who just gave birth have to be fed for breast feeding purpose.
Well, we pay for it and it’s not free though.
Then , comes postnatal. They force you to have Pap smear right a month even if you complain of pain.
Best shot, after 3 Months today I went in to tell them I’m still experiencing a little pain and my nerves over at my left legs were swollen.
Dr told me, I might be having urinary track infection. She didn’t do any physical check on the wound site. For legs she told me to get vitamins but she never prescribe any.
I requested could you please provide me a week or so mc for me to rest. She told me she will
Try !!
Then after paying my bills and collecting medicine for UTI.
The nurse at counter told me we can’t issue for a week. I can issue for today only.
I was bizarre and felt I have engaged the stupidest hospital for my delivery. Why do I need a medical leave today when I’m already on my maternity leave.
So in conclusion, if you are expecting and planning to deliver don’t choose this hospital.
Go to a place where they have got pediatrician in house and not a place where even phototherapy machines are not available.
Horrible!! I’m going to get myself checked in another hospital tonight and if things are not right then I’ll lodge a complain for their careless in taking into patient’s concern seriously.",,,1Negative#Staff#Treatment

I was here just to collect a blood test report and have to wait for more than 2 hours-no difference from the waiting time in government hospital. And whenever I called them they said will get back to me by next day-but they didn’t until I made my 2nd call. What’s more I have to pay few times higher medical fee.

417,"Today I had an appt in health screening, level 4. I arrived around 3pm. One of the staff (pregnant lady) asked me what is the purpose of coming here? I told her that I had an appt to see a doctor to review the blood check up results. Appt made by my relative who works in this hospital. The staff informed me that today the appt was full and the doctor at 4 o'clock wanted to go back. She asked me a question to make an appt with whom? I kept calling my relatives to confirm either appt had made and I was told by my relative appt was made with a staff named ""Arai"" this morning. This ladies staff repeated to me again, informed now there are 20+ more patients and the doctor wants to go back at 4 o'clock! You can wait??? I said yes, I can wait because the appt has been made. I didn't come straight to see a doctor without an appt. At the same time I also saw in the waiting room there were only less than 10 patients who were still waiting. The staff immediately instructed me to sit down first and told me if we could have time to enter my appt for today. Is this a professional staff working in a private hospital? I think your management need to train this staff how to serve customer for better experience. After waiting for almost 1 hour, another staff member called me into the doctor's room. I met the MO (Indian lady) who was also not friendly with the patient. He explained about my result less than 5 minutes, might be the reason because want to go back at 4pm. Before I left the room, i inform her that I want to get a time slip for today's appt. MO ask me, why do you want a time slip when it doesn't take long to see me?This time my blood kept rising to my head. I said i ask for time slip because I left the office during working hours for attend today appt date. Answer i get from this MO, she will discuss first with her staff either can give or cannot and ask me to wait at outside her room. How come MO can gave this stupid answer to patient?? I asked for time slip not MC. After few minutes staff inform me doctor only gave approval start from 3pm until 4.30pm and cannot give me until 6pm. My office location is quite far from this hospital, that is reason i asked until 6pm and i left from this hospital also almost 4.30pm.
No sympathy at all either from staff or MO. I even felt disgusted by their attitude.
Im truly disappointed with service provide by this unit and the attitude of profession. I hope the management office took same action on this matter.",,,1Negative#Appointments#Staff

443,"This is the worse experience that I have ever had  from a hospital. The staff seems inexperienced and untrained with no knowledge on how to manage the patients. I arrived a day early with my elderly mother for a scheduled operation. Upon arrival there was no clear instructions as to what was to happen. The Doctor schedule an operation appointment but when we arrive is seems the staff do not have any record of it. They were sending my mother all over the hospital for numerous test forcing us to carry all our belongings around the hospital rather than settling down in a room before beginning any tests. I was not allowed to accompany my mother during her stay due to covid SOP. I had to leave. The next day after the operation I try to call and get an update but the staff was not able to get me a straight answer and respond with ‘I don’t know’ they were not able to inform me if the operation went well or if my mother has been transferred back to the normal wad. Service is horrible and lousy no consideration for the elderly with walking difficulty. The food in the canteen is horrible and miserable with limited choices and bland taste.
This is the worse experience and I will NEVER come back here again. If I can give a negative star for the service I would. You should train your staff to be more attentive and sensitive to your patients needs. Why open a clinic in a hospital if you are not able to give the basic care to your patients. Please close down so you do not give the next family a heart ache just trying to navigate your inadequate staff and their lack of training. I will be taking my experience to social media to shine a light how low is the standard of this hospital.",,,1Negative#Appointments#Facilities#Staff

The name that i can recall are miss shafiqah & miss lock. Miss Lock was the best nurse when giving the antibiotic using the syringe as it was a painful process but she made it easy & calming. The cleaners were great at their job. They clean & disinfect regularly. And they do “clean” the room. Very efficient. The food was nice. Great choices of menu.
